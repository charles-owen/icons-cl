# icons-cl

I use the jQuery UI icons in some projects and like the look, but
I'm trying to phase out use of jQuery UI, particularly for library
elements, where I don't want that heavy interface included. So,
this is just icons from jQuery UI in a simple-to-use format.
 
## Install

### CDN

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/icons-cl/dist/icons-cl.js"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/icons-cl/dist/icons-cl.min.js"></script>
```

### Package managers

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icons-cl): `npm install icons-cl --save`

## Using the Library

The library consists of only the single .js file icons-cl.js or the
minimized version icons-cl.min.js. The icon images and style sheets are
included in the .js file.

The icons are 16x16 pixels.

To present the trash can icon, use this HTML:

``` html
<span class="icons-cl icons-cl-trash"></span>
```

Content in the span will be ignored.
